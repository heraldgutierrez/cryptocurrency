		h2 Description:
		p A simple scoreboard that was made in a few hours. My family started a small basketball league that started February 1, 2014. This will be projected onto the wall since there is no scoreboard provided at the community centre.
		
		h2 Features:
		ul
			li 'Home' and 'Away' teams can be displayed as 'Black', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red', White', or 'Yellow' teams.
			li Game timer, which can be set to any time amount. Default is 20 mins.
			li 24 second shot clock timer.
			li Adding and Removing points
			li Able to call 30 and 60 second timeouts. This will stop the shot clock and game clock timer, and disable all buttons so nothing can be altered.
			li A timeout arrow is displayed to show who called the timeout.
			li Keep track of fouls. Ensure when foul bonuses occur.
